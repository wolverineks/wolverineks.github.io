      <h3>Designing for Accessibility: An Introduction to Designing for Accessibility</h3>
      <h4>January 25th, 2016</h4>

      <p>
        Most developers probably believe that following good accessibility practices will hinder the user experience for the common user. This may be true to some extent, but most users of your website are likely to benefit from a well accessible website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of your users may be able to read a smaller font, so choosing a larger font with high contrast colors may seem like a sacrifice. However, if the design is easy for people with poorer eyesight, then it will be really REALLY easy for those with perfect eyesight.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think, he talks about making your website as easy to navigate, understand, and use, as possible, for all your users. Large font and high contrast are just one of the ways you can do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many other accessibility design choices that can make your website easy to access for those with disabilities, and even easier to access for those without them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some things to keep in mind when designing for your users:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>6% of your users will probably have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</li>
        <li>10% of male users will be color blind</li>
        <li>15% of your users will be left-handed</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are looking to maximize your website's reach, then these users start to add up. For more information about how to implement accessibility best practices, visit
